# ChurchWebsite-Wix


## ðŸŒŸ About the Project

This is my first real-world project that I worked on independently. The website is designed to provide essential church information, upcoming events, sermons, and donation options.

About â€“ Shares our beliefs, core values, church covenant, articles of faith, and details about the pastor.

Ministries â€“ Provides information on various church ministries and community programs.

Events â€“ Showcases upcoming church events with Wix Forms for easy sign-up.

Sermons â€“ Features recorded sermons with YouTube integration and locally uploaded sermon files using the Wix File Manager.

Contact â€“ Provides contact details and an inquiry form for visitors.

Give â€“ Offers online donation options to support the church.
