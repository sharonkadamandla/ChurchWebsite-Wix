# ChurchWebsite-Wix


## ðŸŒŸ About the Project

This is my first real-world project that I worked on independently. The website is designed to provide essential church information, upcoming events, sermons, and donation options.

## ðŸ“Œ Pages & Features

Home â€“ Displays service timings, an option to join virtually, a slideshow featuring events or important church updates, and an integrated Google Calendar showing weekly events.

About â€“ Shares our beliefs, core values, church covenant, articles of faith, and details about the pastor.

Ministries â€“ Uses custom Wix coding to create an interactive dropdown system where clicking a heading reveals ministry details while closing others, improving focus and reducing confusion.

Events â€“ Showcases upcoming church events with Wix Forms for easy sign-up.

Sermons â€“ Features recorded sermons via Google Drive for playing and downloading sermon files.

Contact â€“ Provides contact details and an inquiry form for visitors.

Give â€“ Offers online donation options to support the church.

## ðŸš§ Project Status & Problem Solving

Structure Completed â€“ All pages and main functionality are now in place.

File Sharing Optimized â€“ Switched to Google Drive for better accessibility and cost-effectiveness.

Custom Coding Added â€“ Overcame Wix limitations by coding an interactive dropdown feature in the Ministries page, ensuring only one section is open at a time to keep the layout clean.
